# Project Summary

In this project, you will be given three levels of practice using HTML and CSS. Each level will contain three steps. Each step will build on the last step and will contain an image file. You can use that image file as reference. The goal is to try to get as close as possible to the image's layout.

# Level 1

## Step 1

* Open `level-1/index.html` && `level-1/step-1.css` && `level-1/step-1.jpg`.
* Locate the element with the class of `content-left`.
  * Position this element to the left side of the screen.
* Locate the element with the class of `content-mid`.
  * Position this element to appear just to the right of `content-left` and take up the remaining space.
* Locate the element with the class of `footer`.
  * Position this element to appear at the bottom of the page.

## Step 2

* Open `level-1/index.html` && `level-1/step-2.css` && `level-1/step-2.jpg`.
* Locate the element with the class of `content-left`.
  * Add padding of 20 pixels on the top, left, right, and bottom.
* Locate the element with the class of `header`.
  * Add padding of 20 pixels on the top, left, right, and bottom.
* Locate the element with the class of `profile-image-container`.
  * Assign a width, height, and margin-bottom.
* Locate the element with the class of `profile-links-container`.
  * Assign a width and height.
* Locate the element with the class of `logo-container`.
  * Assign a width, height, and float.
* Locate the element with the class of `menu-container`.
  * Assign a width, height, and float.



##Directions

* Fork this repo then clone your fork onto your local machine.
* Each level is broken up into three steps. Each step contains an image and a css file.
* The objective is to have a finished product that looks as close to the design as possible.
* Inside the index.html file you  will see the different practice problems. For example Step-1.1 would be step 1 question 1.
* Start with level 1 step 1 question 1 and work your way through the problems
* Your first step should be connecting your CSS files to the index.html
* In every level we have included the possible solution folder please only look at this as a last resort or if you are finished with all the steps and want to see how your solution compares
