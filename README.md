##Directions

* Fork this repo then clone your fork onto your local machine.
* Each level is broken up into three steps. Each step contains an image and a css file.
* The objective is to have a finished product that looks as close to the design as possible.
* Inside the index.html file you  will see the different practice problems. For example Step-1.1 would be step 1 question 1.
* Start with level 1 step 1 question 1 and work your way through the problems
* Your first step should be connecting your CSS files to the index.html
* In every level we have included the possible solution folder please only look at this as a last resort or if you are finished with all the steps and want to see how your solution compares -->

# Project Summary

In this project you will be re-creating multiple html templates using the HTML and CSS skills you have learned so far. There will be 3 levels of difficulty, each being a template and having its own steps to get to the end solution. In each step you will be given a jpeg image that you will need to re-create. Each step will be a continuation of the previous. The goal is to get your project to look as close as you can to the design of the images provided. Good luck!

## Setup

* Clone and fork this GitHub Repo
* `cd` into the project directory

## Important Notes

* In this repo we include a folder named `base`, leave this folder alone. You will not need to change any code in this folder to complete the project.

* Each level has an `index.html` file, you will use the same `index.html` file for each of the steps in the current level.

* To see your progress right click on the `index.html` file you are currently working on and select `show in finder`. Then double click on the `index.html` file. This should open up a browser tab with what you have so far.

## Level 1 Step 1

### Summary

Create a webpage that has the same structure and styling as the `step-1.jpg` image.

### Instructions

* Level 1 Step 1.1
  * We need to place the header on the top of the page.
  * The header automatically gets put at the top of the page because it is the first element on the HMTL file. So we don't need to change the header.

* Level 1 Step 1.2
  * Open `step-1.css`
  * Give `.content-left` a css style of `float: left`.

    <summary> <code> Solution to Step 1.2 </code> </summary>

    ```css
    .content-left{
      width: 33.3%;
      <!-- this height is a placeholder. You will need to make some adjustments to get this container to look like the design -->
      height: 100px;
      background: #565555;
      float: left;
    }
    ```

    </details>


* Level 1 Step 1.3
  * Open `step-1.css`
  * Give `.content-mid` a css style of `float: left`.
  * <details>

    <summary> <code> Solution to Step 1.3 </code> </summary>

    ```css
    .content-mid {
        width: 66.3%;
        <!-- this height is a placeholder. You will need to make some adjustment to get this container to look like the design -->
        height: 100px;
        background: #B0B0B0;
        float: left;
    }
    ```

    </details>


* Level 1 Step 1.4
  * Open `step-1.css`
  * Give `.footer` a css style of `position: absolute` and `bottom: 0`.
  * <details>

    <summary> <code> Solution to Step 1.4 </code> </summary>

    ```css
    .footer {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100px;
        background: #3A3A3A;
        position: absolute;
        bottom: 0;
    }
    ```

    </details>

* Level 1 Step 1.5
  * Now all we need to do is change the height and width on the divs so that your webpage looks as close as it can to the `step-1.jpg`.
