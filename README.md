# Project Summary

In this project, you will be given three levels of practice using HTML and CSS. Each level will contain three or less steps. Each step will build on the last step and will contain an image file. You can use that image file as reference. The goal is to try to get as close as possible to the image's layout.

If you get stuck on a level you can view the solution folder provided in each level. Try to only use this folder as a last resort.

##Directions

* Fork this repo then clone your fork onto your local machine.
* Each level is broken up into three steps. Each step contains an image and a css file.
* The objective is to have a finished product that looks as close to the design as possible.
* Inside the index.html file you  will see the different practice problems. For example Step-1.1 would be step 1 question 1.
* Start with level 1 step 1 question 1 and work your way through the problems
* Your first step should be connecting your CSS files to the index.html
* In every level we have included the possible solution folder please only look at this as a last resort or if you are finished with all the steps and want to see how your solution compares
